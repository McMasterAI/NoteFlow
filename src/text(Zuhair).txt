- Classical conditioning is often called **Pavlovian conditioning**
    - Pavlov noticed that dogs began salivating in the absence of food stimuli — but just prior to the arrival of the food
    - The dogs would begin salivating in response to the sound of the metronome, before even seeing the food — this is because they realized this sound meant food was on the way.
- When an organism learns the association between a signal and an event, a *contingent relationship* is formed between the signal and the event
- Definition of **contingency**:
    - When one event reliably predicts another and leads to the formation of an association between the events
    - E.g. an antelope that is grazing cannot begin to flee a predator only when it spots the predator — by that point it is too late. Therefore the antelope learns associations e.g. sounds and smells that reliably predict the presence of a predator and responds to those cues instead.
- **Classical conditioning:**
    - the learning of a contingency between a particular signal and a later event that are paired in time and/or space

### Components of Classical Conditioning

- ****Unconditioned stimulus (US):****
    - Any stimulus or event that triggers a response naturally, requiring no training / learning
- ****Unconditioned response (UR):****
    - The response that occurs as a result of the unconditioned stimulus
    - Typically biologically programmed (requires no learning)
- ******************************************Conditioned stimulus (CS):******************************************
    - paired with the unconditioned stimulus to form a contingency
    - e.g. the sound of a metronome for Pavlov’s dogs (contingency with food)
- The conditioned stimulus typically appears before the unconditioned stimulus appears. As a result, the conditioned stimulus acts as a predictor for the unconditioned stimulus.
    - may take several trials
    - the organism will eventually learn the contingent relationship
- ******Conditioned response (CR):******
    - the response that occurs once the contingency between the CS and US has been learned.
    - e.g. conditioned stimulus is the metronome and conditioned response is salivation.
- ************************Acquisition:************************
    - the process by which a contingency between a CS and US is learned.
